This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is a common issue in React Native when dealing with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API or using timers.  Here's an example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* This will cause an error if data is still null */}
    </View>
  );
};

```

The problem is that `setData` is an asynchronous operation;  the `Text` component tries to render before the `setData` call has completed and `data` remains `null` causing a TypeError.
